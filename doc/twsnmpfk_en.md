### About AI analysis

- The AI analysis is implemented by setting the log mode to "AI analysis" in the polling settings.
- An anomaly detection of the numerical data of the polling result in isolation forest.
- The results are set to deviation values.
- The deviation value is familiar to school results.It shows how rare it is.
- So, the disability level setting is an expression of once every 10,000 times.
